Generalized Card Game Deck Builder Tool


Background
----------

The initial idea was a Mage Wars deck builder app, but the conversation expanded into some generalized deck building tools.


RulesLawyer
-----------

A sub-set of functionality, possibly backed by a website, that catalogs game rules along with searchable glossary for terms and keywords.
The idea is to be able to link from keywords and icons on cards to their descriptions and any applicable rules.

SL: Could be PDF scans (searchable) of rules books.

Mage Wars Tools
---------------

- Some functionality for sorting cards by type, keyword, etc.
- Automatically calculate spell points based on mage deck
- Make suggestions based on category, mage, points remaining, and current cards in deck
- Save multiple deck configurations, group by mage, tactic types, etc

SL: 
How do you envision the layout of the interface?
List of other (non-Magic) deckbuilders for reference?
Extended Feature: Saved deck comparison simulations.
